🌊 Coral Reef Health Assessment and Forecasting – Florida Keys Data Challenge

This project analyzes coral reef health in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, leveraging datasets from the Coral Reef Evaluation and Monitoring Project (CREMP). It was developed as part of the Conch Republic Coral Quest - Florida Keys Data Challenge, aiming to predict ecological trends using long-term biological and environmental data.

📌 Project Objectives
Evaluate long-term changes in stony coral percent cover, species richness, and octocoral density

Identify spatial variability across reef subregions and monitoring stations

Correlate reef health with temperature trends

Forecast coral reef health through 2028 using Linear Regression and Prophet models

Recommend actionable, stakeholder-specific interventions for reef management

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python (Numpy,Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Prophet)

Google Colab

CREMP Datasets (CSV format)

📈 Key Outputs
13 high-quality visualizations including time trends, correlation heatmaps, species cover, and forecasts

Species Richness and Living Tissue Area (LTA) analysis by station

Linear and Prophet-based time series modeling

Forecast seasonal vulnerabilities and ecological resilience

Actionable conservation and policy recommendations
