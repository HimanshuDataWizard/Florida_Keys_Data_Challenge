🌊 Coral Reef Health Assessment and Forecasting
Florida Keys Data Challenge – Conch Republic Coral Quest
This project analyzes coral reef health within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary using datasets from the Coral Reef Evaluation and Monitoring Project (CREMP). It was developed for the Conch Republic Coral Quest – Florida Keys Data Challenge, with the objective of forecasting ecological trends through exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling.

📌 Project Objectives
Evaluate long-term changes in stony coral percent cover, species richness, and octocoral density

Identify spatial variability across reef subregions and stations

Correlate coral health indicators with temperature trends

Forecast reef conditions through 2028 using Linear Regression and Prophet models

Recommend actionable, stakeholder-focused conservation strategies

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Prophet

Google Colab: For open, cloud-based reproducibility

CREMP Dataset (CSV format)

📈 Key Outputs
✅ 13 high-quality plots: time trends, heatmaps, coral cover, and forecasting

✅ Analysis of Species Richness and Living Tissue Area (LTA) by station

✅ Linear Regression and Prophet-based forecasting models

✅ Visualization of seasonal ecological vulnerability

✅ Actionable, data-backed policy and restoration recommendations
